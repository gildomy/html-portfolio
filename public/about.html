<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Goose, but I am going to tell you more about my Dad. My Dad named
  me after the Top Gun movies which he loves very much. However, the number one
  thing he loves more in this world is my Mom! They met in high school and
  started dating on January 30th 2018. My dad told me she was his very first
  girlfriend as was very nervouse when asking her out. But I am glad she said
  yes because now I have the best parents in the world.

  My dad has been working the past week on becomming a Web Developer and he is
  actually sticking to it this time. He has changed his career path like a
  thousand times but I am glad he finally found something he is passionate
  about. He has been coding for like 3 days in a row for at least an hour! He
  hopes to complete the Coding Bootcamp through Udemy while shadowing with his
  work so he can end up transitioning into a Web Developer once the job opens
